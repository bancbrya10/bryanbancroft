		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>Bio</h2>
		My name is Bryan Bancroft and I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at 
		Temple University. Originally from Quakertown, PA, my road to CS in Philadelphia was all but direct. 
		After I graduated high school, I initially attended the University of Pittsburgh to study 
		mechanical engineering. After more than several inhibitions plagued my academic undertaking, 
		I eventually enrolled at the Community College of Allegheny County where I received my Associate's
		degree in Computer and Information Systems. To avoid the most certainly inevitable outcome of 
		being forced to move back home and live with my mom, I sought to fund my living expenses via a
		supplementary occupation, which initially began as a dishwasher at a local restaurant. Through
		hard work and determination, and admittedly undeserved recognition from my coworkers and superiors, 
		I worked my way up the line, first with a promotion to line cook, and eventually sous chef.
		Although proud of my accomplishments in the restaurant, these promotions came with their setbacks which cost me the
		ability to retain my exemplary GPA, however I still managed to gruaduate in good academic standing
		while working 30+ hours per week. Now, having more or less recovered from my initial academic debacle,
		my focus and aspirations have never been more aligned. I intend to seek an internship this
		summer and have already applied to several on campus IT positions at Temple for the Spring. My goal is to graduate
		with a Bachelor's and a strong enough resume to launch my career in IT. But I realize that school
		can only account for so much of my education. Therefore it is my goal to actively participate in
		the ever-changing world of tech by logging all of the self-motivated learning I intend to accomplish
		on this website.</br></br>
