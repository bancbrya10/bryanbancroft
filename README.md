This is a blog I put together to keep track of all the projects and other things I have been keeping myself busy with outside of the classroom. Admittedly, I haven't been updating it as frequently as I would have intitially liked, but it's coming along pretty well after only a few months. I'll try to get some of the source codes on github when I get a chance too, especially when I get come of the bigger projects in full swing.
